-------------------
This analysis examines how the ratio of liveness to safety clauses affects solver performance when clause lengths follow a Poisson distribution, extending the regular Problem 6 analysis to investigate the impact of statistical clause length variation on solver behavior.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
------------------
- Formula sizes tested: 100, 200, 500 clauses
- Clause lengths: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 literals (Poisson distributed)
- Liveness:Safety ratios tested: 90:10, 80:20, 65:35, 50:50, 35:65, 20:80, 10:90
- Solvers tested: vampire, snake, z3, prover9, cvc5, e, inkresat
- Total test scenarios: 21 (3 formula sizes × 7 ratios)
- Distribution type: Poisson (vs. regular uniform distribution in Problem 6)

POISSON DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS:
------------------------------------
• Clause length variation follows Poisson probability distribution
• Creates more realistic, non-uniform clause length patterns
• Introduces statistical variability in formula structure
• Models real-world logical constraint distributions more accurately

CONCLUSION:
================================================================

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that while Poisson distribution introduces measurable performance variations, high-quality solvers maintain excellent robustness to statistical clause length changes. The impact of liveness/safety ratios remains consistent under both regular and Poisson distributions, with distribution type serving as a secondary performance factor.

Snake and Vampire emerge as the most statistically robust solvers, maintaining excellent performance under both distribution types. Z3 provides perfect consistency across statistical variations, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring predictable performance.

The study validates that solver selection should prioritize statistical robustness for real-world applications, where clause length distributions often follow patterns similar to the tested Poisson model. The results support the use of statistically robust solvers for production systems requiring reliable performance under varying constraint distributions.
