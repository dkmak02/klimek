PROBLEM 7 ANALYSIS REPORT: IMPACT OF FORMULA COMBINATION METHODS ON SOLVER PERFORMANCE
================================================================

EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW:
-------------------
This analysis examines how different methods of combining multiple logical formulas affect solver performance, specifically comparing disjunction (OR) versus conjunction (AND) combinations. This study provides insights into how formula structure and logical operators impact computational complexity and solver efficiency.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
------------------
- Formula combination: Three sub-formulas F₁, F₂, F₃ combined into compound formula G
- Variant A (Disjunction): G = (F₁) ∨ (F₂) ∨ (F₃) 
- Variant B (Conjunction): G = (F₁) ∧ (F₂) ∧ (F₃)
- Test formula: G ⇒ R (converted to ¬G ∨ R)
- Result clause R: Simple liveness clause with 4 atoms/literals (one with ∃ quantifier)
- Formula size tested: 200 clauses per sub-formula
- Sub-formula composition: 50% liveness + 50% safety clauses each
- Solvers tested: vampire, snake, z3, prover9, cvc5, e, inkresat

LOGICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------
• Disjunction (OR): At least one sub-formula must be satisfied
• Conjunction (AND): All sub-formulas must be satisfied simultaneously
• Implication structure: Tests logical consequence relationship
• Compound complexity: Three-way logical combinations with different constraints

CONCLUSION:
================================================================

This analysis reveals significant insights into how formula combination methods affect solver performance. While most solvers demonstrate good robustness to structural variations, Snake shows notable sensitivity with clear performance advantages for conjunctive structures. The study validates that conjunction-based formulas generally offer better performance characteristics across multiple solvers.

The results support the development of structure-aware optimization strategies and demonstrate the importance of considering logical organization in solver selection and formula design. For practical applications, choosing structurally robust solvers like Vampire and Prover9 ensures consistent performance, while structure-sensitive solvers like Snake can provide optimized performance when combination patterns are known.

The complete success rate across all solvers for both combination methods validates the experimental methodology and confirms that both disjunctive and conjunctive formula combinations are well-supported by modern SAT/SMT solvers.
