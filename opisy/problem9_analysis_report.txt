focusing on asymmetric properties, semantic dominance, and dynamic evolution.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
===================

Performance Impact of Complexity Asymmetry:
- Asymmetric subalternation (G) shows 10-20x higher resource usage than symmetric variants
- Memory usage scales significantly with the larger subformula (F₂: 1000 clauses)
- Snake solver particularly affected by complexity asymmetry (69.669 MB vs ~8-9 MB in other variants)

Semantic Asymmetry Impact:
- Safety/liveness dominance (H) shows balanced performance despite semantic asymmetry
- 80% safety vs 80% liveness distribution doesn't significantly impact solving efficiency
- All solvers maintain consistent SAT results, suggesting robust semantic handling

Dynamic Evolution Stability:
- Evolution variant (I) demonstrates stable performance across solvers
- 10% clause modification maintains good solver agreement
- Performance similar to baseline, indicating evolution stability

SOLVER RANKING BY VARIANT
=========================

Overall Best Performers:
1. CVC5: Consistently lowest memory (0.018-0.160 MB) and fastest execution (0.004-0.026 s)
2. Vampire: Very efficient memory usage (1.410-7.254 MB) and fast execution (0.005-0.035 s)
3. Z3: Consistent performance across variants, moderate memory usage (17.620-18.650 MB)

Variant-Specific Observations:
- Snake: Struggles with complexity asymmetry but handles other variants well
- E: Only participated in dynamic evolution, showing moderate performance
- All solvers showed 100% SAT agreement across all variants

KEY FINDINGS
============

1. COMPLEXITY ASYMMETRY IMPACT:
   - 10x clause difference (100 vs 1000) creates significant performance challenges
   - Memory usage increases dramatically with formula size asymmetry
   - Some solvers (Snake) more sensitive to complexity asymmetry than others

2. SEMANTIC ASYMMETRY TOLERANCE:
   - Safety/liveness distribution asymmetry (80%/80%) well-handled by all solvers
   - Semantic asymmetry appears less impactful than structural complexity asymmetry
   - Consistent SAT results across different semantic priorities

3. EVOLUTION STABILITY:
   - 10% clause modification represents stable evolution threshold
   - All solvers maintain consistent results despite formula changes
   - Performance remains stable during requirement evolution

4. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   - CVC5 and Vampire recommended for asymmetric complexity scenarios
   - Semantic asymmetry less concerning than structural asymmetry for solver performance
   - Dynamic evolution shows promise for requirement versioning analysis

5. LOGICAL SQUARE EXTENSIONS:
   - Asymmetric variants provide valuable insights into real-world requirement modeling
   - Different complexity levels within logical relationships create interesting challenges
   - Evolution analysis applicable to software requirement management

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

For Asymmetric Complexity Problems:
- Use CVC5 or Vampire for best performance
- Expect significant resource scaling with complexity asymmetry
- Monitor Snake solver performance on highly asymmetric problems

For Semantic Asymmetry Scenarios:
- All tested solvers handle semantic asymmetry well
- Safety/liveness dominance doesn't significantly impact performance
- Semantic modeling choices less critical than structural choices

For Dynamic Evolution Analysis:
- 10% modification represents stable evolution threshold
- All solvers show good stability for requirement evolution
- Dynamic analysis viable for requirement management applications

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============
- Analysis based on average results from 3 runs per configuration
- European decimal notation used in source data (commas as decimal separators)
- Timeout threshold: 100 seconds (not reached in any variant)
- Some solvers (prover9, inkresat) showed errors and were excluded from detailed analysis

FUTURE WORK SUGGESTIONS
=======================
1. Test larger complexity asymmetries (100x, 1000x differences)
2. Explore semantic asymmetry with different safety/liveness ratios
3. Analyze larger evolution steps (20%, 50% modifications)
4. Test contradiction emergence during evolution process
5. Apply to real-world requirement specification evolution

CONCLUSION
==========
The logical square variants analysis reveals important insights into how structural 
and semantic asymmetries affect SAT solver performance. While structural complexity 
asymmetry creates significant performance challenges, semantic asymmetry is well-tolerated. 
The dynamic evolution analysis shows promise for practical requirement engineering 
applications, particularly in modeling and analyzing requirement specification changes 
over time. CVC5 and Vampire emerge as the most robust solvers across all variant types.
