This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that liveness/safety ratio variations have minimal impact on solver performance for the tested scenarios. High-quality solvers (Snake, Vampire, Z3) show remarkable robustness to constraint type distribution changes, making them reliable choices across diverse application domains.

For practical applications, the results support flexible constraint modeling without performance penalties, enabling developers to focus on logical correctness rather than performance optimization through ratio manipulation. The consistent behavior across ratios provides confidence in solver reliability for varying problem structures.
