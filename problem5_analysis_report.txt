PROBLEM 5 ANALYSIS REPORT: IMPACT OF FORMULA SIZE ON SOLVER PERFORMANCE
================================================================

EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW:
-------------------
This analysis examines how the size of logical formulas affects the time and memory consumption of various SAT/SMT solvers, with a focus on formulas containing constant-length clause groups.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
------------------

- Clause lengths: 1, 5, 10, 20 literals (constant within each formula)
- Solvers tested: vampire, snake, z3, prover9, cvc5, e, inkresat

DISTRIBUTION SCENARIOS:
----------------------
a. Balanced Distribution (even): All clause length groups contribute 25% each
b. Short-biased Distribution (more_short): Length-1 clauses = 1%, others = 33% each
c. Long-biased Distribution (more_long): Length-20 clauses = 1%, others = 33% each

CONCLUSION:
================================================================

This analysis demonstrates that solver choice significantly impacts performance when dealing with varying formula sizes and clause length distributions. Vampire and Snake emerge as the most scalable and efficient solvers, while E solver shows limitations for larger formulas. The impact of clause length distribution is generally minimal for most solvers, with the exception of E solver which shows sensitivity to longer clauses.

For practical applications involving large formulas with mixed clause lengths, Vampire and Snake are recommended for their superior scalability and efficiency. Z3 provides a reliable middle-ground option with consistent performance characteristics.

The results highlight the importance of solver selection based on specific problem characteristics and resource constraints in automated theorem proving applications.
