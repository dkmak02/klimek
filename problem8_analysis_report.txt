PROBLEM 8 ANALYSIS REPORT: LOGICAL SQUARE RELATIONSHIPS IMPACT ON SOLVER PERFORMANCE
================================================================

EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW:
-------------------
This analysis examines how different logical square relationships between two formulas affect solver performance and satisfiability outcomes. The study investigates three classical logical relationships (contradictory, subcontrary, subalternated) under both regular and Poisson distributions, providing insights into how logical structure complexity impacts computational requirements and solver behavior.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
------------------
- Base formulas: F₁ and F₂ (50% liveness + 50% safety clauses each)
- Formula sizes tested: 100, 200, 500 clauses per formula
- Clause lengths: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 literals
- Solvers tested: vampire, snake, z3, prover9, cvc5, e, inkresat

LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS TESTED:
----------------------------
a) Contradictory: (F₁ ⇒ ¬F₂) ∧ (¬F₁ ⇒ F₂)
   - Exactly one of F₁ or F₂ must be true, never both or neither
   
b) Subcontrary: ¬(¬F₁ ∧ ¬F₂)  
   - At least one of F₁ or F₂ must be true (can be both)
   
c) Subalternated: (F₁ ⇒ F₂) ∧ ¬(F₂ ⇒ F₁)
   - F₁ implies F₂, but F₂ does not imply F₁ (asymmetric relationship)

d-f) Poisson variants of relationships a-c with statistical clause length distribution

CONCLUSION:
================================================================

This comprehensive analysis reveals fundamental differences in how solvers handle logical square relationships under different statistical distributions. The study demonstrates that while regular distributions provide reliable and predictable logical reasoning environments, Poisson distributions create significant challenges with solver disagreement and satisfiability uncertainty.

Vampire emerges as the most reliable solver across all scenarios, maintaining 100% SAT consistency regardless of distribution type. The critical finding that Z3 and CVC5 show systematic UNSAT patterns under Poisson distributions while Vampire, Snake, and E maintain SAT results highlights fundamental implementation differences in statistical handling.

For practical applications, the results strongly recommend Vampire for statistical robustness, while emphasizing the need for multiple solver validation in uncertain environments. The study establishes that logical relationship complexity is amplified by statistical variation, requiring careful consideration of both factors in solver selection and system design.
